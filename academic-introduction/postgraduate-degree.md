# 🗞️ Postgraduate Degree

Methods and materials for master’s and taught courses As a student on a master’s or other postgraduate taught course at The University of Manchester, you’ll benefit from our excellence in teaching methods and the very best learning environments and materials.

As well as this, you’ll learn from leading teachers and scholars who are acknowledged international experts in their respective fields.

You’ll develop skills and gain experience that will be fundamental to your future career. We employ a wide variety of teaching techniques, from traditional laboratory-based work, lectures, and seminars to e-learning.

Teaching and learning methods at the postgraduate level can be quite different from those at the undergraduate level. How you are taught will largely depend on your course content, level of study, and your academic tutor – but, however you are taught, you will be required to undertake a large proportion of your study independently.

Since most of our master’s courses are only one year in duration, the academic experience can be quite intense compared to an undergraduate degree. As a master’s student, you will begin to specialize in topics that interest you or start to work on a particular area of research that you may wish to undertake for further study.

Studying at a postgraduate level involves a greater emphasis on self-directed study than at an undergraduate level. You’ll be expected to think and study independently, conduct more extensive background reading, and bring your ideas to seminars and tutorials for discussion and debate.

A 12-month program including subject-specific taught course units, research skills training and a substantial research project, or series of research projects. Research master's degrees include the MSc by Research and the Master of Enterprise (MEnt).

### Master of Philosophy (MPhil) <a href="#master-of-philosophy-mphil" id="master-of-philosophy-mphil"></a>

Usually lasting 12 months and assessed by the submission and examination of a shorter thesis than that required for a Ph.D., setting out the results of an original, individual program of investigational research. Where appropriate, successful completion of the MPhil (including the preparation of a detailed plan for a doctoral research project) may be followed by registration for a Ph.D.

A two-year research program leading to an award in recognition of the successful completion of a program of supervised research in any area of medicine.

A two-year research program leading to an award in recognition of the successful completion of a period of supervised research in the theory and/or practice of surgery.

### Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) <a href="#doctor-of-philosophy-phd" id="doctor-of-philosophy-phd"></a>

Lasting between three and four years and awarded in recognition of the successful completion of a program of supervised research within the allocated time, the results of which show evidence of originality and independent, critical judgment and constitute an addition to knowledge. Although instructional courses may be included in the training, you spend most time undertaking independent research, with progress closely monitored throughout the period of study. Assessment is based upon an oral examination of your final thesis.

Provides you with the opportunity to undertake a research project with an external partner, either from another higher education institution or from industry or commerce. Collaborative PhDs can be undertaken on a split-site basis or as a joint award. Please contact the relevant School or Faculty for further information.

### Professional, Engineering, and Enterprise Doctorate Programs <a href="#professional-engineering-and-enterprise-doctorate-programs" id="professional-engineering-and-enterprise-doctorate-programs"></a>

a five-year, part-time blended learning program designed to meet the needs of senior professionals who seek to improve their critical thinking and research skills while pursuing their profession. The DBA is awarded by the University in recognition of the successful completion of research training and supervised research, the results of which are embodied in a thesis comprising evidence of the candidate’s capacity to conduct a comprehensive and critical analysis of the relevant literature, and to carry out substantial fieldwork designed to extend current knowledge. The thesis should make an original and substantial addition to the knowledge that will also be relevant to a business, government, or not-for-profit organization, and have the potential to make significant improvements to practices.

### Centers for Doctoral Training (CDT) PhD <a href="#centers-for-doctoral-training-cdt-phd" id="centers-for-doctoral-training-cdt-phd"></a>

a four-year integrated research degree combining taught courses with a programme of supervised research leading to the production of the doctoral research project. We offer a strong focus on interdisciplinary research to foster cutting-edge international competitive research.
